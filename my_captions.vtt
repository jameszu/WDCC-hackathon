There are a few different ways we can define functions in Javascript

00:08.155 --> 00:13.615
We looked at one particular type called Arrow Functions

00:15.220 --> 00:17.950
so, lets define one!

00:23.000 --> 00:27.085
so if we wanted to define a constant, we define it this way

00:27.105 --> 00:29.215
right, lets define a constant first!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
If you wanted to define a function

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
we can do it the same way

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
say constant squared

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
equals two

00:44.735 --> 00:47.450
take no parameters

00:47.450 --> 00:49.450
and then return

00:52.760 --> 00:56.395
sorry, take one parameter, n obviously 

00:56.415 --> 00:59.215
because we are trying to do a square 

01:00.000 --> 01:01.940
of a given number

01:01.960 --> 01:05.745
and return 

01:08.065 --> 01:11.385
n times n
